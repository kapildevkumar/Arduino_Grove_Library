# Arduino_Grove_Library
In this library, I have made it easy to use Arduino Grove Sensors by creating functions that can be just invoked in Arduino to use each sensor in Arduino Grove Sensor kit. Embedded modules beginners, can learn basics of Arduino and easily use Grove kit sensors. I have made it using Object Oriented Programming.
